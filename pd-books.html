                        <li><strong>10 minutes Implementation:</strong> Choose <strong>one</strong> concept or actionable idea from your reading and consciously practice it. This bridges theory with real-world application.</li>
                        <li><strong>5 minutes Reflection:</strong> (Evening journal on progress). A brief check-in. What resonated today? How did you apply it? What challenges arose? This cements learning and fosters self-awareness.</li>
